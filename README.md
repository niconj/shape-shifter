# shape-shifter

A Vue - Typescript canvas playground using Konva.js

shape-shifter presents the user with a whiteboard where shapes loaded from an external api are added on the first load.

The user can modify any shape on the board by selecting them, as a transformation visual aid will appear and will let the user change the shape size, position and rotation angle.

As a shape is selected, the user can change it's position moving it to the `left` or the `right` by pressing the arrow keys on their keyboard. The selected shape cab be deleted by pressing the `delete` button on the keyboard, or the `x` button on the lower section of the board.

The user can add randomly placed rectangles by pressing the corresponding button on the lower section of the whiteboard.
